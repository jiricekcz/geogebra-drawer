# Canvasio
Canvasio is a simple 2D canvas library. This isn't a huge project and it has fairly limited functionalities, but if you have an idea for what to add, feel free to let me know. As I am the only one working on this library, the testing for all functions isn't very thorough, so bugs in code are very well possible.
## Documentation 
When it comes to documentation, as of now unfortunately canvasio has no web documentation. This is probably going to change once the library is fully released. For now, documentation is written in the .d.ts files, which come with the source code. If you place the .d.ts file in the same folder as the source code, your IDE should be able to covert the file into tooltips and InteliSense. If you prefer reading the whole documentation it is still possible just to read the .d.ts file, but it may be somewhat confusing, if you don't fully understand the Typescript and JSDoc syntax.
